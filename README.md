# HoldF9PoE
When your active window is Path of Exile, F9 is pressed and held, otherwise it is released.
I use this to make sure I always have attack in place on.
# Why?
I'd been using the scripting that came with my logitech keyboard to keep attack in place toggled, but it kept having issues.
# Note
If you press F9 for whatever reason while in-game (like when you switch to using F9 as the key for attack in place), you'll need to alt-tab out and back in for it to work again.
