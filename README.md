# HoldF9PoE
When your active window is Path of Exile, F9 is pressed and held, otherwise it is released.
I use this to make sure I always have attack in place on.
# Why?
I'd been using the scripting that came with my logitech keyboard to keep attack in place toggled, but it kept having issues.
# Notes
If you press F9 for whatever reason while in-game (like when you switch to using F9 as the key for attack in place), you'll need to alt-tab out and back in for it to work again.  
  
If for some reason you want to toggle it off in-game, you can just change your attack in place key.  
  
At the moment there is no visual indicator, but you can open up your task manager to see that it is running.
